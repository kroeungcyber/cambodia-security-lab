# Data Protection Security Implementation

## Encryption Implementation
- Uses AES-256-GCM authenticated encryption
- Key derivation via PBKDF2 with 100,000 iterations
- Random salt (128-bit) and nonce (96-bit) generation
- Base64 encoding for safe transport of binary data

## Security Enhancements for Cambodia

### Access Controls
- IP-based restrictions for Cambodian government networks
- Rate limiting (5 requests/minute for encryption/decryption)
- Production environment restrictions

### Authentication Security
- Strict password policy enforcement:
  - Minimum 12 characters
  - Requires uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters
  - Localized error messages in English and Khmer

### Transport Security
- HTTPS enforcement in production
- Security headers:
  - Strict-Transport-Security
  - X-Content-Type-Options
  - X-Frame-Options  
  - X-XSS-Protection
  - Content-Security-Policy

### Monitoring & Compliance
- Detailed security logging:
  - Failed authentication attempts
  - Password policy violations
  - Encryption/decryption errors
- Logs include timestamps and source IPs

## Implementation Notes
- Designed for ASEAN compliance requirements
- Localized for Cambodian government use
- Security controls documented in GRC/asean-compliance.md
