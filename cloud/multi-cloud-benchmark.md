# Multi-Cloud Security Benchmark for Cambodia

## Introduction
This document provides security benchmarks for AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure, tailored to Cambodia's cybersecurity landscape and compliance requirements.

## Common Security Principles
- Enforce least privilege access
- Mandate multi-factor authentication (MFA)
- Encrypt all sensitive data (at rest and in transit)
- Implement comprehensive logging and monitoring
- Regular security assessments and audits

## Identity and Access Management

### AWS IAM
- Use IAM roles with strict policies
- Enable MFA for root and privileged accounts
- Regularly rotate access keys

### Google Cloud IAM
- Implement organization policies
- Use service accounts with minimal privileges
- Enable Identity-Aware Proxy for secure access

### Azure Active Directory
- Configure conditional access policies
- Enable Privileged Identity Management
- Use managed identities for resources

## Data Protection

### All Providers
- Use customer-managed encryption keys
- Implement data classification
- Enable backup and disaster recovery

### Cambodia-Specific
- Store sensitive data in Singapore or regional zones
- Comply with Cambodian data sovereignty laws
- Use government-approved encryption standards

## Network Security

### AWS
- Configure VPC with private subnets
- Use security groups and network ACLs
- Enable AWS Shield and WAF

### Google Cloud
- Configure VPC Service Controls
- Use Cloud Armor for DDoS protection
- Enable Private Google Access

### Azure
- Implement Azure Firewall
- Configure Network Security Groups
- Use Azure DDoS Protection

## Monitoring and Logging

### All Providers
- Enable audit logging for all services
- Centralize logs in SIEM solution
- Set alerts for suspicious activities

### Cambodia Enhancements
- Monitor for region-specific threats
- Retain logs for minimum 1 year
- Report incidents to Cambodian CERT

## Compliance

### ASEAN Requirements
- Align with ASEAN cybersecurity frameworks
- Document compliance with local regulations
- Regular third-party audits

## Implementation Guide
1. Assess current cloud usage
2. Prioritize high-risk areas
3. Implement controls incrementally
4. Train staff on cloud security
5. Continuous monitoring and improvement
