# Enhanced AWS Cloud Security Benchmark for Cambodia Cybersecurity Landscape

## Introduction
This document provides an enhanced benchmark for securing AWS cloud environments tailored to the current cybersecurity landscape in Cambodia. It incorporates global best practices and regional compliance requirements.

## Identity and Access Management (IAM)
- Enforce least privilege access principles.
- Use multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all privileged accounts.
- Regularly review and rotate IAM credentials.
- Implement IAM roles with strict policies for services and users.
- Monitor and log IAM activities using AWS CloudTrail.

## Data Protection
- Encrypt data at rest using AWS KMS with customer-managed keys.
- Use TLS 1.2 or higher for data in transit.
- Implement automated backups and test restoration procedures.
- Use AWS Config to monitor encryption compliance.

## Network Security
- Use Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with private subnets for sensitive resources.
- Implement security groups and network ACLs with restrictive rules.
- Use AWS WAF and Shield for protection against web attacks and DDoS.
- Monitor network traffic with VPC Flow Logs and AWS GuardDuty.

## Monitoring and Logging
- Enable AWS CloudTrail for all regions and services.
- Centralize logs using Amazon CloudWatch Logs and AWS S3.
- Set up alerts for suspicious activities and anomalies.
- Use AWS Security Hub for continuous compliance checks.

## Incident Response
- Develop and test an incident response plan specific to cloud environments.
- Use AWS Systems Manager for automated remediation.
- Maintain an inventory of cloud assets and configurations.

## Compliance and Governance
- Align with ASEAN cybersecurity frameworks and Cambodia's cybersecurity regulations.
- Use AWS Artifact to access compliance reports.
- Regularly audit cloud resources and configurations.

## Training and Awareness
- Provide cloud security training tailored to Cambodian IT staff.
- Promote awareness of cloud-specific threats and best practices.
